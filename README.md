# Applied Cryptograph Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various applied cryptography algorithms from fundamental concepts. The purpose of this project is to provide a collection of algorithms used in cryptography, implemented in Python.

## Features

- Implementation of fundamental cryptography algorithms.
- Examples and use cases for each algorithm.
- Comprehensive documentation for understanding and using the algorithms.

## Setup

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kclaudeeager/Applied-Cryptograph-algorithms.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd Applied-Cryptograph-algorithms
```
## Usage
Each algorithm is implemented as a separate Python module. You can run these modules directly or import them into your own projects.
